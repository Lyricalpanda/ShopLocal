## SBJson

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a light-weight data interchange
format that's easy to read and write for humans and computers alike.
This library implements strict JSON parsing and generation in
Objective-C.

Features
========

* Streaming Support (see SBJsonStreamParser & SBJsonStreamWriter)
* Configurable recursion depth limit
* Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)
* Optionally sort dictionary keys in JSON output
* Optional pretty-printing of JSON output

Links
=====

* [GitHub project page](http://github.com/stig/json-framework)
* [Online API docs](http://sbjson.org/api/3.2)
* [SBJson tag on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sbjson)


Installation
============

The simplest way to start using JSON in your application is to copy all
the source files (the contents of the `Classes` folder) into your own
Xcode project.

1. In the Finder, navigate into the `Classes` folder.
2. Select all the files and drag-and-drop them into your Xcode project.
3. Tick the **Copy items into destination group's folder** option.
4. Use `#import "SBJson.h"` in  your source files.

That should be it. Now create that Twitter client!

*If you're upgrading from a previous version, make sure you're deleting the
old SBJson classes first, moving all the files to Trash.*


Alternative Installation Instructions
=====================================

* With Xcode 4's workspaces it has become much simpler to link to dependant
projects. The examples in the distribution link to the iOS library and Mac
framework, respectively. Des Hartman wrote [a blog post with step-by-step
instructions for iOS][link-ios]. This is the recommended way if you need to
make local changes to SBJson.
* You can also install SBJson using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).
